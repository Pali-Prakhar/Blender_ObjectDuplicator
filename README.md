# Blender_ObjectDuplicator
This script makes it easier to duplicate one object and place it at the exact same position and orientation of another object.


In Blender 2.8x and above:
-Load the script.
-Copy the name of your Object and place it as the name of the source object by replacing text in brackets and quotations.
-Select the object you need replacing and run the script, it should add a duplicate of the source object at the correct coordinates and angles for you.

It should be apparent that I cannot code. I scraped together this script to help with long sessions of replacing my High poly chair models with lighter, baked models by doing each placement individually hundreds of times for large, public interior renders.

If anyone who knows this better can add more functionality like batch replacements and addon UI, feel free to modify and upload it and send me a link so I can use it as well.
